#i had to retrieve the folder id so i went through each folder to get it for dsp revenue files. we can set this as root and then append DSP names to this

#items = client.folder(folder_id='40972602395').get_items(limit=100, offset=0)

# root_folder = client.folder(folder_id='0').get()

# insights_folder = client.folder(folder_id='37941806175').get()

# ias_deliv_folder = client.folder(folder_id='38986776380').get()

# int_del_folder = client.folder(folder_id='38986776636').get()

# dsp_root_folder = client.folder(folder_id='38986780216').get()
